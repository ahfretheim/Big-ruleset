; rule_name     = (optional) internal name for savegames, rulesets etc; if

;                 and any others they inherit.
;                 Giving "None" explicitly here prevents a tech from
;                 inheriting root_reqs in this way, and stops root_req
;                 inheritance through that tech.
;                 Specifying a tech's root_req as itself means that the tech
;                 can only be acquired by special means (nation's init_techs,
