# Big-ruleset

A freeciv ruleset with a much smaller early game year-step and a much more extensive tech, unit & government-type tree for longer, more extensive freeciv campaigns. Made for version 2.6. Doesn't seem to work well with current freeciv AI, but should be good for multiplayer games. Tests indicate much more realistic tech development than in other known rulesets, more corresponding with the true experience of mankind. Also less centered on the West in terms of its wonders.
